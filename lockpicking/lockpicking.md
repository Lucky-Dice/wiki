# Lock Picking

Lock Picking, the art of deciphering or exploiting locks without harming them. The term Lock Picking comes from the act of 
manually setting every pin in a pintumbler lock using a lockpick. These days Lock Picking also covers other techniques and is
considerd to be the name of the art of hacking locks.

## Classical Lock Picking

A classic pintumblr is made out of a cilinder and a lock body. When the cilinder turns it opens the door, starts your car
or sends a nuclear bomb to America. In order to turn the cilinder you need the correct key (or not?).
What the key does is align all the pin's to the sheerline (the separation between the cilinder and the lock body) and free's the
cilinder in order to be able to rotate freely and give the action through to the external locking mechanism.

Lock Picking (picking pins in a cilinder-kind lock) is made possible by the fact that it's 
extremely complicated to drill all the pin holes in perfect alignment. This results in the vulnerability
to set the lock pin by pin. See it as being to able to guess individual digits of a 4 digit code.
Instead of having 9999 different codes to guess you have 10+10+10+10=40 maximal numbers to guess in order to break the code.

This shows us that the classical pintumbler lock's design is not defect, it's just damn hard to craft a perfect lock.

## General Lock Picking

Give a random lock to a hobbyist and he will be glad to fiddle with it untill it opens.
There is no perfect lock but there are hundreds of different designs trying to achieve this.

This introduces a lot of different techniques to crack locks:

### Combination locks

### Tubular pin tumbler lock

### Shimming

### Bumping
