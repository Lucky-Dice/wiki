# Hackers.wiki


Welcome fella's. 

We are currently setting everything up. Check back later!

just a tesst.

## Proposal for inner workings

See this as a community project.
My (simplect's) proposal for the wiki:

The wiki is basically a frontend for a git repository. The repository holds everything from wise knowledge to total bullshit. 

The development branch will be public for everyone to add .md's, code files etc. Then there is a rating system. Highly rated files will be added to a trending development. When the file is significantly trending because of real human voting one of the maintainers will merge it to the master branch.

In order to ease merging and keep structure the development branch will be dropped every week and a new development branch will be checkedout.


## Current state

### Working
- Git integration
- Authentication (github authentication)
- More features originally in Realms wiki

### Todo
- Dev/Master branch separation
- Maintainer status
- Rating system
- Trending list
- ???
