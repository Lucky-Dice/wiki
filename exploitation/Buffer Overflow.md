# Buffer Overflow

Buffer Overflow was one of the most common security vulnerabilities in the past. Where everyone was using low-level languages
and security was something for the future, the fun for a hacker started at the segfault.

At the time of writing (2016) Buffer Overflows are still found in the wild, though more rare and hard to exploit, they still
are a threat to human mankind. Modern compilers and computers are filled with features to make classic Buffer Overflows
harder to exploit. Though in the end these are all quickfixes to patch a hole introduced by lazy programmers.

Features to harden the security include ASLR, Stackprotectors or Canaries and others.

##From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

>In computer security and programming, a buffer overflow, or buffer overrun, is an anomaly where a program, while writing data to a buffer, overruns the buffer's boundary and overwrites adjacent memory locations. This is a special case of the violation of memory safety.

>Buffer overflows can be triggered by inputs that are designed to execute code, or alter the way the program operates. This may result in erratic program behavior, including memory access errors, incorrect results, a crash, or a breach of system security. Thus, they are the basis of many software vulnerabilities and can be maliciously exploited.

>Programming languages commonly associated with buffer overflows include C and C++, which provide no built-in protection against accessing or overwriting data in any part of memory and do not automatically check that data written to an array (the built-in buffer type) is within the boundaries of that array. Bounds checking can prevent buffer overflows.
