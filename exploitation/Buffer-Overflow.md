# Buffer Overflow

Buffer Overflow was one of the most common security vulnerabilities in the past. Where everyone was using low-level languages and security was something for the future, the fun for a hacker started at the segfault.

The basic concept of a Buffer Overflow is that you find a way to overflow the assigned piece of memory to you. You can see this "assigned piece of memory" as a safe place for all your userinput or other savings you as an outsider store in there. As long as your input is kept in this place and the programmer uses this place safely (cleans it up after use etc.) then there is not much wrong. But when you find a way to write data beyond the walls of this safeplace, then you are overflowing. 

The overflow part can be fully harmless and only change some variables, like next to your safehaven there was a variable which stores the power of a nuclear bomb in megatons, would not change much if that variable changed from 1 to 100, right??
But next to your assigned memory there could me essential variables and often most interesting, execute locations.

In a classic stack overflow, the goal is to overwrite the return value of a function. See it as a function was called, the origin calling that function, stored it's return value (where the to-be-called function needs to return when it's done), but the called function is vulnerable, resulting in a Buffer Overflow. Then the hacker overwrites the return value and instead of going back to the original (non-vulnerable) function the program goes wherever the hackers likes it to go.

Imagine an autonomous war device returning to a function singing the My Little Pony intro rather than destroying the alien enemy, that's pretty bad.

At the time of writing (2016) Buffer Overflows are still found in the wild, though more rare and hard to exploit, they still are a threat to human mankind. A big part of the modern infrastructure still runs on software written in these low-level languages (c/c++, etc), this in combination with non-security minded programmers is asking for problems. 

Modern compilers and computers are filled with features to make classic Buffer Overflows
harder to exploit. Though in the end these are all quickfixes to patch a hole introduced by lazy programmers.

Features to harden the security include ASLR, Stackprotectors or Canaries and others.

## From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

>In computer security and programming, a buffer overflow, or buffer overrun, is an anomaly where a program, while writing data to a buffer, overruns the buffer's boundary and overwrites adjacent memory locations. This is a special case of the violation of memory safety.

>Buffer overflows can be triggered by inputs that are designed to execute code, or alter the way the program operates. This may result in erratic program behavior, including memory access errors, incorrect results, a crash, or a breach of system security. Thus, they are the basis of many software vulnerabilities and can be maliciously exploited.

>Programming languages commonly associated with buffer overflows include C and C++, which provide no built-in protection against accessing or overwriting data in any part of memory and do not automatically check that data written to an array (the built-in buffer type) is within the boundaries of that array. Bounds checking can prevent buffer overflows.
