# Social engineering

Social engineering is the art of crafting a conversation, encounter or other means of real-life interaction.
Face-to-face a human is usually at it's weakest, but sometimes even at it's strongest.

We are fed up with online rules, don't do this, don't tell that and especially don't enter a webcam chat with a stranger. 
But these rules don't apply to the real world for the general public.

Look at the separation between real life, real conversations and conversations online with people who could be different than what they claim (see what I did here?).

We usually assume that whoever comes up to us claiming to be X to actually be X, but when somebody on the internet claims to be X we know that this somebody could by X, Y OR Z. Building on these presumptions we can quickly see that the general public has build up an online shield. We get spammed by local authorities: don't get phished, don't get scammed. But nobody warns for real life situations? This is where social engineering comes in place.

Social engineering is about the art of rooting an company building. Instead of getting root access to the main SCADA C&C center, you get to sit in the presidents chair. It's about engineering an person played by yourself, impersonating barack obama or being able to convince Obama's secretary that Obama planned an icecream date with you and his secretary.
