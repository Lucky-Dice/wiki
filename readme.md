Welcome fella's. The wiki is in development. The frontend will change, the content will change, everything will probably change.

We are looking for writers! Fork, write, pull request. And if we like you we might invite you to become a mantainer.

## Some articles to start
[Buffer Overflow](http://hackers.wiki/exploitation/Buffer-Overflow.md)

[Lock Picking](http://hackers.wiki/lockpicking/lockpicking.md)





## Notes

The wiki front-end currently only parses Markdown: https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet
Code is also more than welcome. Use coding standards; or else Torvalds will strangle you in your sleep.

### Can I contribute

Yes! https://github.com/Hackerswiki/wiki/ FORK -> CHANGE -> COMMIT -> PULL REQUEST.

### What should be on this wiki?

Everything, from total bullshit to wise knowledge. 

### Decentralized

We are working on a decentralized approach. The goal is to leave Github and have the git distributed among readers and editors in order to provide persistence.

### Evilzone.org

This wiki is a project by one of the long time staff members on Evilzone.org. A forum was not the right place for great content so that was when this wiki was born. 

###License 

If you care about sharing knowledge consider pasting the following license into your wiki:

> This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.

### Security of the wiki

The wiki is hosted on a VPS with nothing else on it. The wiki uses a read-only deployment key to pull the git every minute. So hacking the wiki is useless and just a waste of your own time.
